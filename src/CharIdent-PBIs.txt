PBIâ€™s for Character Identifier 
Help from Drew and Will's group

As a user, I need somewhere to paste a character, so I can know how to code it in various programs.

As a user, I need to the view the character in large type, so I can know what the character specifically is. 

As a user, I need to view the java code for the character, so I can program it in Java.

As a user, I need to view the entities, so I can generate the characters in different programs. 

As a user, I need to view the hex and decimal unicode number for the character, so I can represent the character in any programming language. 

As a user, I need to view the text description of a character, so I know what it is. 

As a user, I need to view the UTF-8 code, so I can present the character, lightly and efficently, in a program that allows certain characters. 

Miles-PseudoCode

get jframe

add arrays of characters from Entities package and Unicode consortium

add arrays of all alpha, hex and unicode numbers

jlist has all of the characters, and have the input automatically find it

selection listener added in for jlist, sets alpha and hex variables to numbers for exact character

method for displaying character largely, and showing all the values, and the description
